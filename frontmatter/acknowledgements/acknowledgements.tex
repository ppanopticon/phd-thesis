\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Finishing a project such as the one described in this Thesis is never the sole achievement of one person alone. And while I may be the author of the text it contains and the mind behind the concepts and systems it describes, there is a great many people that have somehow enabled the successful completion of this dissertation. It is those sung and unsung heroes that I shall dedicate these acknowledgements to.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Heiko Schuldt, who offered me this position and who convinced me five years ago, that doing a PhD is a unique opportunity not to be missed. The past five years indeed were time very well spent on interesting projects with interesting people and I am grateful for the experience and the guidance you have given me along this journey. I also wish to thank Prof. Dr. Björn Þór Jónsson, who volounteered as my external examiner. Reading this Thesis must have been a daunting task indeed and I very much hope that the experience was at least somewhat pleasant.

I would also like to take the opportunity to give a big shout-out to our DBIS research group with all its amazing members both past and present. I really enjoyed our many lunches, discussions about politics, progress reports, and of course the mandatory gossip on the second floor. A special thanks goes to Silvan Heller, Loris Sauter, Marco Vogt, Alexander Stiemer, Florian Spiess and Mahnaz Parian-Sherb as well as our former members Luca Rossetto and Ivan Giangreco who I do not only consider valued colleagues but also dear friends.  

The process of writing and finishing a Thesis like this can be taxing and at times downright frustrating. In this situation, it is invaluable to have colleagues who share the same predicament and with whom one can talk about the progress, the setbacks, and just the general state of mind. Therefore, a loud, emphatic ``thank you'' to both Marco and Silvan for establishing and holding on to our ``Thesis Reading Circle'', and for the many hours of discussions, and the invaluable feedback you have provided.

Team DRES (Loris and Luca) also deserves a special mention: It is not often that one finds people whom working with is as productive and pleasant as it is with you two and I really would like to thank you for this. We have achieved a lot together and I am certain that there are still many interestin ideas to be realised, side-projects to be started, papers to be written, and discussions to be had.

I would also like to acknowledge and thank my dear friend Andrea Schäfer for reading my entire Thesis and providing me with feedback on the English language. I guess without you, reading this damn thing would be even more painful than it likely already is anyway. And I also acknowledge Luca Rossetto for occasionally providing feedback on bits and pieces.

Of course, I also want to thank my friends and family -- all those of you who allowed and enabled me to wind down from the at times stressful experience of working on this project. A heartfelt ``thank you'' and, once again, a big shout-out to all of you -- also for the patience you have shown over the past few years.

There is also a person who deserves a special mention here -- my wonderful and beloved partner, Jonas. We have been together for over thirteen years, but the past five years probably were among the most challenging. Balancing two occupations, the purchase and renovation of a house, the well-being of a herd of rabbits, and life in general certainly is no easy task and it would not have been possible without your unwavering support. Thank you for being there for me -- in good and in bad times, as they say -- and for having my back no matter what adventure I embark on.

And last but not least, thanks a lot to everyone who has not been mentioned explicitly yet is implicitly meant: The students and colleagues whom I have had the honour of working with, the administrative staff who makes sure that everything runs smoothly and all the generations of researchers whose efforts have enabled this small contribution that I am trying to make with this Thesis. To everyone who has supported me directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, willingly or unwillingly -- thank you very much!
