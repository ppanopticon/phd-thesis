\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Successfully finishing a project such as the one described in this Thesis is never the sole achievement of one person alone. And while I may be the author of the text you read and the inventor of the concepts and systems you read about, there is a great many people that have somehow influenced the (hopefully) successful completion of this dissertation.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Heiko Schuldt, who offered me this position and who somehow convinced me five years ago, that doing a PhD is a unique opportunity better not to be missed. The past five years indeed were time very well spent on interesting projects with interesting people and I am grateful for the guidance you have given me along this journey. I also whish to thank Assc. Prof. Dr. Björn Thór Jónsson, who volounteered as my external examinor. Reading this Thesis of mine must have been a daunting task indeed and I very much hope that the experience wasn't an all too boring one.

When talking about being talked into doing a PhD there is another name I must mention, which is that of Luca Rossetto. Ever since you supervised my Master's Thesis five years ago, you have been a great friend and an amazing colleague to work with. I have always valued your quick way of thinking, your frank way of sharing your thoughts and oppinions and your open-mindedness about new ideas and projects.

I would also like to take the opportunity to give a big shoutout to our DBIS research group with all the amazing people it comprises of. I really enjoyed our many lunches, discussions about politics, progress reports and of course the mandatory gossip on the second floor. A special thanks goes to Silvan Heller, Loris Sauter, Marco Vogt, Florian Spiess and Mahnaz Amiri Parian-Sherp as well as our former members Luca Rossetto and Ivan Giangreco who I do not only consider valued colleagues but also dear friends.

The process of writing and finishing-up a Thesis can be taxing and downright frustrating at times. In this situation, it is valuable to have colleagues that share the same predicament and with whom one can exchange about the progress, the set backs and just the general state of mind. And therefore a huge, additional ``thank you'' to both Marco and Silvan for establishing and holding onto our ``Thesis Reading Circle'' and for the many hours of dicussion and the invaluable feedback you have provided.

I would also like to acknowledge my dear friend Andrea Schäfer for reading my entire Thesis and providing me with English language feedback. I guess without you, reading this damn thing would be even more painful than it probably is anyway.

And last but least I would like to thank my many friends -- all those of you who allowed and enabled me to wind down from the at times stressful experience of working on this project. A heartfelt ``thank you'' and, once again, a big shoutout for all of you.

No there is a one last person that deserves to be mentioned here which is my dear and beloved companion, Jonas. We have had over thirteen years together and the past fiver year probably were among the most challenging. However, despite the trials and tribulations we faced, we always managed to be there for one another and I am just grateful for your continued support for whatever enedevour I embark on
