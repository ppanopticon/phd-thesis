Instead of attribute matching approaches, access methods based on object similarity are becoming popular in many applications. Nowadays, efficient methods for similarity search are already available, but using them to build an actual search system still requires specialists that tune the methods and build the system. In this paper, we propose a novel query language that generalizes existing solutions and allows to formulate content-based queries in a flexible way, supporting various advanced query operations such as similarity joins, reverse nearest neighbor queries, or distinct kNN queries, as well as multi-object and multi-modal queries. The language is primarily designed to be used with the MESSIF \textendash{} a framework for content-based searching \textendash{} but can be employed by other retrieval systems as well.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces RankSQL, a system that provides a systematic and principled framework to support efficient evaluations of ranking (top-k) queries in relational database systems (RDBMS), by extending relational algebra and query optimization. Previously, top-k query processing is studied in the middleware scenario or in RDBMS in a "piecemeal" fashion, i.e., focusing on specific operator or sitting outside the core of query engines. In contrast, we aim to support ranking as a first-class database construct. As a key insight, the new ranking relationship can be viewed as another logical property of data, parallel to the "membership" property of relational data model. While membership is essentially supported in RDBMS, the same support for ranking is clearly lacking. We address the fundamental integration of ranking in RDBMS in a way similar to how membership, i.e., Boolean filtering, is supported. We extend relational algebra by proposing a rank-relational model to capture the ranking property, and introducing new and extended operators to support ranking as a first-class construct. Enabled by the extended algebra, we present a pipelined and incremental execution model of ranking query plans (that cannot be expressed traditionally) based on a fundamental ranking principle. To optimize top-k queries, we propose a dimensional enumeration algorithm to explore the extended plan space by enumerating plans along two dual dimensions: ranking and membership. We also propose a sampling-based method to estimate the cardinality of rank-aware operators, for costing plans. Our experiments show the validity of our framework and the accuracy of the proposed estimation model.},

Extended Cluster Pruning (eCP) is a highly-scalable approximate indexing approach based on clustering, that is targeted at stable performance in a disk-based scenario. In this work, we propose an index maintenance strategy for the eCP index, which utilizes the tree structure of the index and its approximate nature. We then develop a cost model for the strategy and evaluate its cost using a simulation model.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of the World Wide Web has brought information retrieval (IR) techniques to the forefront of search technology. To the average computer user, ``searching'' now means using IR-based systems for finding information on the WWW or in other document collections. IR query evaluation methods and workloads differ significantly from those found in database systems. In this paper, we focus on three such differences. First, due to the inherent fuzziness of the natural language used in IR queries and documents, an additional degree of flexibility is permitted in evaluating queries. Second, IR query evaluation algorithms tend to have access patterns that cause problems for traditional buffer replacement policies. Third, IR search is often an iterative process, in which a query is repeatedly refined and resubmitted by the user. Based on these differences, we develop two complementary techniques to improve the efficiency of IR queries: 1) Buffer-aware query evaluation, which alters the query evaluation process based on the current contents of buffers; and 2) Ranking-aware buffer replacement, which incorporates knowledge of the query processing strategy into replacement decisions. In a detailed performance study we show that using either of these techniques yields significant performance benefits and that in many cases, combining them produces even further improvements.},

It addresses the specific, yet important, problem of efficiently and effectively finding the approximate k-nearest neighbors within a collection of a few billion high-dimensional data points. The NV-Tree is a very compact index, as only six bytes are kept in the index for each high-dimensional descriptor. It thus scales extremely well when indexing large collections of high-dimensional descriptors. The NV-Tree efficiently produces results of good quality, even at such a large scale that the indices cannot be kept entirely in main memory any more. We demonstrate this with extensive experiments using a collection of 2.5 billion SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors.},
