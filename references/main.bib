  abstract = {The paper presents new developments in an extension of Codd's relational model of data. The extension consists in equipping domains of attribute values with a similarity relation and adding ranks to rows of a database table. This way, the concept of a table over domains (i.e., relation over a relation scheme) of the classical Codd's model extends to the concept of a ranked table over domains with similarities. When all similarities are ordinary identity relations and all ranks are set to 1, our extension becomes the ordinary Codd's model. The main contribution of our paper is twofold. First, we present an outline of a relational algebra for our extension. Second, we deal with implementation issues of our extension. In addition to that, we also comment on related approaches presented in the literature.},

  abstract = {For complex data types such as multimedia, traditional data management methods are no longer suitable. Instead of attribute matching approaches, access methods based on object similarity are becoming popular in many applications. Nowadays, efficient methods for similarity search are already available, but using them to build an actual search system still requires specialists that tune the methods and build the system. In this paper, we propose a novel query language that generalizes existing solutions and allows to formulate content-based queries in a flexible way, supporting various advanced query operations such as similarity joins, reverse nearest neighbor queries, or distinct kNN queries, as well as multi-object and multi-modal queries. The language is primarily designed to be used with the MESSIF \textendash{} a framework for content-based searching \textendash{} but can be employed by other retrieval systems as well.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of the World Wide Web has brought information retrieval (IR) techniques to the forefront of search technology. To the average computer user, ``searching'' now means using IR-based systems for finding information on the WWW or in other document collections. IR query evaluation methods and workloads differ significantly from those found in database systems. In this paper, we focus on three such differences. First, due to the inherent fuzziness of the natural language used in IR queries and documents, an additional degree of flexibility is permitted in evaluating queries. Second, IR query evaluation algorithms tend to have access patterns that cause problems for traditional buffer replacement policies. Third, IR search is often an iterative process, in which a query is repeatedly refined and resubmitted by the user. Based on these differences, we develop two complementary techniques to improve the efficiency of IR queries: 1) Buffer-aware query evaluation, which alters the query evaluation process based on the current contents of buffers; and 2) Ranking-aware buffer replacement, which incorporates knowledge of the query processing strategy into replacement decisions. In a detailed performance study we show that using either of these techniques yields significant performance benefits and that in many cases, combining them produces even further improvements.},

It addresses the specific, yet important, problem of efficiently and effectively finding the approximate k-nearest neighbors within a collection of a few billion high-dimensional data points. The NV-Tree is a very compact index, as only six bytes are kept in the index for each high-dimensional descriptor. It thus scales extremely well when indexing large collections of high-dimensional descriptors. The NV-Tree efficiently produces results of good quality, even at such a large scale that the indices cannot be kept entirely in main memory any more. We demonstrate this with extensive experiments using a collection of 2.5 billion SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors.},

While the query performance and quality of these methods has been well studied, however, the performance of index maintenance has not yet been reported in any detail. Here, we focus on the dynamic behavior of the balanced NV-tree, which is a disk-based approximate index for very large collections. We report on an initial study of the effects of several implementation choices for the balanced NV-tree, and show that with appropriate implementation, significant performance improvements are possible. Overall, the proposed techniques not only reduce maintenance cost, but can also improve search performance significantly with minimal loss of search quality.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the most recent additions to the vitrivr retrieval stack, which will be put to the test in the context of the 2019 Video Browser Showdown (VBS). The vitrivr stack has been extended by approaches for detecting, localizing, or describing concepts and actions in video scenes using various convolutional neural networks. Leveraging those additions, we have added support for searching the video collection based on semantic sketches. Furthermore, vitrivr offers new types of labels for text-based retrieval. In the same vein, we have also improved upon vitrivr's pre-existing capabilities for extracting text from video through scene text recognition. Moreover, the user interface has received a major overhaul so as to make it more accessible to novice users, especially for query formulation and result exploration.},
